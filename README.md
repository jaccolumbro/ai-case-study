# Epic Systems Corporation
## Overview and Origin
Epic Systems Corporation, commonly known as Epic, was founded in 1979 by Judith Faulkner in Madison, Wisconsin. Faulkner, a computer programmer and now the company's CEO, started the company with the goal of improving healthcare through technology.
Over the years, Epic has grown to become one of the largest and most influential Electronic Health Records (EHR) vendors in the United States, servicing a range of healthcare organizations, including hospitalize, inpatient/outpatient clinic, physician practice, long-term care facilities, and academic medical centers. 
## The Idea
Fouded in a basement, in 1979 with three part-time employees, Judith Faulkner had the goal to improve healthcare practices through technology and its advancements. Faulkner recognized the inefficiencies and challanges of working with paper-based medical records and saw an opportunity to digitize and centralize patient information to provide timeliness and accuracy with care delivery. With Faulkner's vision, Epic facilitated healthcare providers with access to their patient's entire medical history, which lead to better clinical decision making skills and improved patient outcomes. Epic Systems Corporation not only created an EHR system with digitized medical records but also integrated other systems and enabled data exchange between various healthcare organizations, in addition to providing patient engagement and population health management. At this time, EHR was an innovative and holistic approach to healthcare IT; currently Epic is one of the leading EHR vendors in the United stated, with a reputation for innovation, usability, and interoperability. 
## Funding
Epicâ€™s revenues are generated by selling software to healthcare providers, largely hospitals and health systems, but smaller medical groups as well. As reported by Forbes, Epic generates $3.8 billion annually. 

# Business Activities
## Lets ask the creator: "What did your customers, including the physicians, want you to solve?"
> "The problem they were trying to solve was twofold. One, they wanted to keep information about patients, but they wanted to define for themselves what that information was going to be. They wanted to create their own screens. They wanted to define their own data elements. And two, they wanted clinical information.
Back then, database management systems were not widely available, so people did not define their own screens. And the systems available were billing, like IDX, and labs, like Cerner, but they were not clinical information systems.
So those were the twin problems I was trying to solve: the ability to define your own data elements for clinical information.
But there is a third part to it too. It was not meant to be one-time static information. It was meant to be information that would keep going over time so you could look back at the history of that patient or look forward to the plans and future schedules of that patient, rather than just, here is a frozen-moment-in-time snapshot." -Judith Faulkner

## Landscape
### Market
Epic Systems Corporation holds a strong position in the Healthcare IT market.

Epic Systems is a developer, manufacturer, licenser, supporter, and seller of a privately owned digital medical record software app that is known as Epic or the Epic EMR (Electronic Medical Records). The software is primarily based on Epic's own database management system known as Chronicles.

### Major Trends in Healthcare IT
Through a partnership with Microsoft, Epic launched its own generative AI technology, four months after the debut of ChatGPT. With it, Epic hopes to add AI to some of its most recognizable platforms, including MyChart and the patient management app Rover, to reduce administrative tasks for clinicians and allow patients to schedule appointments with just a few text messages from a chatbot.

Any AI suggestions, such as after-visit summaries, messages or medication orders, have to be reviewed and confirmed by clinicians before being sent to patients.

And while machine-based learning isnâ€™t new to Epic â€” there are already nearly 2,200 functions within its software â€” the company hopes itâ€™ll decrease worker burnout and decrease administrative costs.

#### Key Trends
- **Interoperability**: There has been a push for greater interoperability between EHR systems, allowing different systems to seamlessly exchange patient information. Epic and other EHR vendors have worked to improve interoperability through standards such as HL7 and FHIR.

- **Mobile Access**: The rise of mobile technology has led to an increased focus on mobile access to EHR systems. Epic and other EHR vendors have developed mobile applications that allow clinicians to access patient information from smartphones and tablets.

- **Patient Engagement**: There has been a growing emphasis on patient engagement, with EHR systems offering tools to help patients access their own health information, communicate with their providers, and participate in their care.

- **Population Health Management**: EHR systems have evolved to include population health management tools, allowing healthcare organizations to analyze data from their patient populations to identify trends, manage chronic diseases, and improve overall health outcomes.

- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: AI and machine learning have been increasingly integrated into EHR systems to help improve clinical decision-making, automate tasks, and improve the accuracy of diagnoses.

- **Cloud Computing**: There has been a shift towards cloud-based EHR systems, which offer greater scalability, flexibility, and accessibility compared to traditional on-premise systems.

- **Telemedicine Integration**: With the rise of telemedicine, EHR systems have begun to integrate telemedicine capabilities, allowing clinicians to conduct virtual visits and consultations with patients.

These trends and innovations have helped to shape the modern EHR landscape, making systems more user-friendly, interoperable, and capable of supporting the evolving needs of healthcare organizations and their patients.
