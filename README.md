# Epic Systems Corporation
## Overview and Origin
Epic Systems Corporation, commonly known as Epic, was founded in 1979 by Judith Faulkner in Madison, Wisconsin. Faulkner, a computer programmer and now the company's CEO, started the company with the goal of improving healthcare through technology.
Over the years, Epic has grown to become one of the largest and most influential Electronic Health Records (EHR) vendors in the United States, servicing a range of healthcare organizations, including hospitalize, inpatient/outpatient clinic, physician practice, long-term care facilities, and academic medical centers. 
## Originating the Idea
Fouded in a basement, in 1979 with three part-time employees, Judith Faulkner had the goal to improve healthcare practices through technology and its advancements. Faulkner recognized the inefficiencies and challanges of working with paper-based medical records and saw an opportunity to digitize and centralize patient information to provide timeliness and accuracy with care delivery. With Faulkner's vision, Epic facilitated healthcare providers with access to their patient's entire medical history, which lead to better clinical decision making skills and improved patient outcomes. Epic Systems Corporation not only created an EHR system with digitized medical records but also integrated other systems and enabled data exchange between various healthcare organizations, in addition to providing patient engagement and population health management. At this time, EHR was an innovative and holistic approach to healthcare IT; currently Epic is one of the leading EHR vendors in the United stated, with a reputation for innovation, usability, and interoperability.
