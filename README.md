# Epic Systems Corporation
## Overview and Origin
Epic Systems Corporation, commonly known as Epic, was founded in 1979 by Judith Faulkner in Madison, Wisconsin. Faulkner, a computer programmer and now the company's CEO, started the company with the goal of improving healthcare through technology.
Over the years, Epic has grown to become one of the largest and most influential Electronic Health Records (EHR) vendors in the United States, servicing a range of healthcare organizations, including hospitalize, inpatient/outpatient clinic, physician practice, long-term care facilities, and academic medical centers. 
## The Idea
Fouded in a basement, in 1979 with three part-time employees, Judith Faulkner had the goal to improve healthcare practices through technology and its advancements. Faulkner recognized the inefficiencies and challanges of working with paper-based medical records and saw an opportunity to digitize and centralize patient information to provide timeliness and accuracy with care delivery. With Faulkner's vision, Epic facilitated healthcare providers with access to their patient's entire medical history, which lead to better clinical decision making skills and improved patient outcomes. Epic Systems Corporation not only created an EHR system with digitized medical records but also integrated other systems and enabled data exchange between various healthcare organizations, in addition to providing patient engagement and population health management. At this time, EHR was an innovative and holistic approach to healthcare IT; currently Epic is one of the leading EHR vendors in the United stated, with a reputation for innovation, usability, and interoperability. 
## Funding
Epicâ€™s revenues are generated by selling software to healthcare providers, largely hospitals and health systems, but smaller medical groups as well. As reported by Forbes, Epic generates $3.8 billion annually. 

# Business Activities
## Lets ask the creator: "What did your customers, including the physicians, want you to solve?"
> "The problem they were trying to solve was twofold. One, they wanted to keep information about patients, but they wanted to define for themselves what that information was going to be. They wanted to create their own screens. They wanted to define their own data elements. And two, they wanted clinical information.
Back then, database management systems were not widely available, so people did not define their own screens. And the systems available were billing, like IDX, and labs, like Cerner, but they were not clinical information systems.
So those were the twin problems I was trying to solve: the ability to define your own data elements for clinical information.
But there is a third part to it too. It was not meant to be one-time static information. It was meant to be information that would keep going over time so you could look back at the history of that patient or look forward to the plans and future schedules of that patient, rather than just, here is a frozen-moment-in-time snapshot." -Judith Faulkner
